            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THou knoweſt, or mayeſt know, how this truth I here preſent thee with, hath been, and yet is, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved of by the moſt: yet is moſt true, and approved by God in his own Word, by which I have proved it; and alſo by ſound natural reaſon, with which, two invincible Weapons of the Holy Ghoſt, I have put to flight, all Objections that may be made againſt this Truth: So that I conceive, hee muſt needs declare himſelf an Enemy to Chriſts Kingdome, voyd of both grace and good reaſon, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>And whereas men in our dayes, are divers and different, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Preachers of the Goſpel; ſome being of opinion, that ſome of the Saints only may preach it; that is to ſay, ſuch only as are Vniverſity-Scholers: others, that none at all may or can preach it. Wheras I, according to my ſmall talent, do hold, &amp; have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this tract, that all, &amp; every of the Saints are called to preach the Goſpel, according to what they have received, and do conceive of Jeſus Chriſt: And for the better reſolving and ſatisfying of my diſſcenting Brethren of each ſide; I will declare, firſt the nature
<pb facs="tcp:159925:3"/> of the promiſing I here mean, and that in the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> following I do ſpeak of. Secondly, I will ſhew the neceſſity that there is of ſuch preaching, and both of them by the Word of God. 1 The nature of the promiſing or preaching of the Goſpel I here mean, is no other thing then a holding out to others by the Word, that light or knowledge, that any one apprehends from the Word to be of Chriſt, according to that Exhortation, 1 Pet. 4.10 II. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo minister the ſame one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as good Stewards of the manifold graces of God. If any man ſpeake, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God. If any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be praiſe and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>But there is an ordinary (but an unmercinary) objection made by many againſt this Doctrine, and it is this; The Goſpel is preached by ſuch as were ſent to preach it: And therfore, as there are none ſent ſo by Chriſt now; ſo there is no need, nor no abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in men to preach now, Rom. 10.15. Now that I may anſwer this the clearer, I will ſhew, 1 what preaching meaneth. 2 how manifold the preaching of the Goſpel is, and both of them by the Word of God. 1. Preaching is as much as to ſay, publiſhing to others what they know not, according to that of our Saviour, Mat. 10.27. <hi>What I tell you in darkneſſe, that ſpeak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye on the houſe tops, or publiſh ye abroad.</hi> So that to declare to others what they know not, is in the Goſpels account preaching. 2 There is a two-fold preaching of the Goſpel. 1. There was a preaching of the Goſpel by inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, 2 Tim. 3.16, which preaching is now ceaſed, Ro: 10.15. 2. There is a preaching of that which is preached already, Acts 15.21. <hi>Moſes</hi> of old time hath in every City them that preach him (that is to ſay, that preach his works, or what he from God had preached before, Luk. 16.29. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them;</hi> that is, they have the Propheſies of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets: For <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were dead before Chriſt ſpake this, and before he was born. Therefore it was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Propheſies, that of old time had in every City them that preach them,) being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day: So that to read the Scriptures, and to expound them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="tcp:159925:3"/> is preaching in the phraſe of Scripture; and thus they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, Neh. 8.8. So they read in the book of the Law of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, &amp; gave the ſenſe, and cauſed them to underſtand the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: thus our Saviour preached, Luke 4.16. — 21. and 24.7 32. And thus the Goſpel that hath been preached by inſpiration from God, is to be preached ſtill by the Saints, till all be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Epheſ. 4.11, 12, 13. and he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers (what to do?) for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt (for how long?) til we all come in the Vnity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man (no member wanting in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) unto the meaſure of the ſtature, or age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, every member being perfected in grace, &amp; for glory. Now 2. the neceſſity that there is of the preaching of this Goſpel, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be great, as by what hath been ſaid already: So likewiſe by this that followes, they that live now did not hear the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets, &amp;c. when they preached the Goſpel: Neither can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that are now alive read what they have preached and written ſome having never learned Letters, others being born blind, and could not learn to read: a third ſort could read, but now cannot, viſited with blindneſſe: all which ſhewes the neceſſity of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel now to be great, either by reading it, or by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, by comparing ſpiritual things with ſpirituall things; to wit, the Scripture with it ſelf, text with text, 1 Cor. 2.13. Ro: 7.14. Joh. 6.63. Thus you have ſeen both the nature and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the propheſying or preaching, of which I ſpeak and mean in the tract enſuing. Wherein, I have both by Scripture and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument cleared up this truth; that to ſpeak with tongues, is not eſſential to the being of a Prophet, or, that divine propheſying is not reſtrained to humane learning; and ſo conſequently, that all the Saints are Prophets to preach the Goſpel one to another: for which cauſe, I call my book, <hi>The Preachers Plea,</hi> which I have written according to the meaſure of my talent, to informe the Reader: And I do adviſe thee alſo to declare it, and thy ſelfe for it, for the information of others with whom thou haſt to doe; which being performed by any, though by illiterate or unlearned men; be you ſo far from deſpiſing of it for the Preachers ſake, as
<pb facs="tcp:159925:4"/> accept and prize it for the Authors ſake: to wit, Chriſt: and the leſſe thou ſeeſt of man in mens preaching; be carryed on to ſee the more of Chriſt in it, to the prayſe of his free grace, by a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart in the words of grace; ſaying, Matth. 11.25, 26. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to Babes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemes good in thy ſight.</hi> Reader, then let it not ſeeme evill in thy ſight, that the Babes of Chriſt ſhould reveal to one another, and to others what Chriſt hath revealed to them: <hi>For out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings God ſoundeth ſtrength (Pſalm.</hi> 8:3.) <hi>that he might ſtill the Enemy and the Avenger, and that all may learn, and all be comforted,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.30, 31. which is the will of him who is the husband and head of his body, the Church. In whom I, (a member of his) am thine, to ſerve him,</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knowing the excellency of Tongues, and the benefit that might (by the bleſſing of God) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Churches by the right uſe of them; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were then of divers languages, as appeares in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. and ſo had need to be inſtructed every one in his own language, whereby onely they could be edified, appeares in the 9.10. and 11. verſes: whereupon <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I would that yee all ſpake with Tongues.</hi> And this he ſpeaks either to the Prophets in particular, that they might be able to ſpeak to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Churches ingenerall, who were then of divers tongues; or elſe to the Church ingenerall, that they might every one, as well as any one, be able to underſtand the Prophets in what language ſoever they ſpake or propheſied.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe ſeeing the Church ready to abuſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent guift of Tongues to vain oſtentation; and withall, ready to preferre it above the gift of propheſy, the moſt excellent ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159925:5"/> gift, being moſt of all neceſſary for the Churches edification: he exhorts them in the firſt verſe, to follow after charity, and to deſire ſpirituall gifts, but rather that they may propheſie, and the reaſon he gives, verſe 2, 3 4 as I before did: and then having ſhewed the excellency of both theſe gifts (that each might have their due without offence to either) he ſhewes the excellency of it above the other, verſe 5. <hi>I would that yee all ſpake with tongues, but rather that yee propheſied: for greater is he that propheſieth, then he that ſpeaketh with tongues:</hi> as if hee had ſaid, to ſpeak with tongues is the moſt deſirable humane gift; but yet farre inferior to propheſying, which is the moſt excellent ſpirituall gift for the Church: <hi>For greater is he that propheſieth, then he that ſpeaketh with Tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then theſe two are diſtinct gifts, the one humane, the other divine; the one excellent, the other moſt excellent; the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Churches edification, the other of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the one may be in the Church, the other muſt be: and as tongues may be without propheſie; ſo may propheſie be without the tongues. And ſo the ſum of all is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That to ſpeak with tongues is not eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet: Or,</p>
            <p>That Divine Propheſying is not reſtrained to Humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>This is very cleare from the words in the Text, <hi>Greater is he that propheſieth, &amp;c.</hi> Intimating thus much, that they are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct gifts, and that a man may have the gift of tongues without the gift of propheſie; and that another may have the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie without the tongues. Yea the ſame is alſo ſpecified in the 39. verſe, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Brethren, covet to propheſie, and forbid not to ſpeak with tongues.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. to another the working of miracles, to another propheſie, to another diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſpirtts, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. Likewiſe verſe 28, 29, 30. God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles; ſecondarily, Prophets; thirdly, Teachers: and after that, miracles, then gifts of healings, helps in Government, diverſities of tongues; where he ſheweth by way of order, both the dignity and diſtinction of gifts; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many, thoſe of Propheſie, and ſpeaking with Tonngues.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:159925:5"/>
            <p>Then he goes on by way of quaere: <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? Doe all ſpeak with tongues? Doe all interpret?</hi> So that it is very cleare, that to ſpeake with tongues, is not eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons why divine propheſying is not reſtrained to humane learning, may be theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe propheſying is the greater gift: <hi>For, greater is he that propheſieth, &amp;c.</hi> Now the greater may not, nor muſt not be reſtrained to the leſſer; but the leſſer to the greater: the greater is not tyed to the approbation of the leſſer; but the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to the approbation of the greater. And without all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>The leſſe is bleſſed of the greater,</hi> Heb. 7.7. Matth. 23.17.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe propheſie is one of the capitall fruits and benefits of Chriſts victory and aſcenſion, derived to his Church, as in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8.13. Wherefore he ſaith, When he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men: And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors, and ſome Teachers, for the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. Wherefore divine propheſying cannot bee reſtrained unto humane learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe propheſying is reſtrained to the gift of God onely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. How ſhall they preach except they be ſent? And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. No man taketh this honor unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe no true Prophet (though never ſo profound a Scholar in humane learning) ever did, or will preach, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie by vertue of his humane learning, nor will take upon him to preach the Goſpel becauſe of it; but by vertue, and becauſe of his ſpirituall illumination, and ſanctification by the Spirit thereunto; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> propheſied and preached Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.18. there, ſaith he, I thank God, I ſpeake with tongues more then you all: yet <hi>Paul</hi> propheſied not by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159925:6"/> vertue hereof, but onely by the grace of God that was in him. Compare this place with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. where hee ſaith, By the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was beſtowed upon me, was not in vain, but I laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly then they all: (and leſt any ſhould yet conceive hee did any thing in the miniſtery by or of himſelfe, he addes) yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me: wherefore to ſpeak with tongues, or humane learning, is not eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Our own bleſſed experience in the times wherein wee live; in which the Lord is pleaſed in a very large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to make good his promiſe this very way even to us, as to his Church in former time, as was propheſied by <hi>Joel</hi> in his ſecond chapter, v. 16, 17. which was accompliſhed and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled upon the Apoſtles, as appeares <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. All which I ſay, is made good unto us in our time: For doe we not (or at leaſt may we not) heare even illiterate men ſpeak in our own tongue, the wonderfull works of God? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.11. Of whoſe propheſying (in reſpect of what Prophets were heretofore) we may ſay as it was ſaid of Chriſt by the Scribes. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>9. That as Chriſt, ſo his people now teach, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving authority, and not as the Scribes. Wherefore divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying is not reſtrained to humane learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> We read in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. that no propheſie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of any private interpretation: wherefore privat men, which are unskilled in the Languages and Sciences, are not to preach or propheſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If this be ſo expounded, then of neceſſity you muſt conclude, that <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſealed up the little book, which is no other but the Goſpel which <hi>Peters</hi> Maſter, and our Lord Jeſus, the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> hath opened to all the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate people, as well as to the greateſt Clerkes, if not more fully: For if illiterate men may not adventure the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of what they read, to gain the ſenſe and true meaning thereof as they read, they were better not read at all. And whoſoever dares maintain this opinion, is not onely guilty of ſlandring the truth of Chriſt, but doth alſo ſubmit to the Pope; whoſe ſubtilty it is (as much as in him lieth) to ſeale up by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159925:6"/> his Chaplaines and Miniſters what Chriſt hath unſealed and opened; to the very end that all his people, great and ſmall, bond and free, may freely read, expound, and edifie thereby.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that this expoſition of the words of <hi>Peter</hi> is falſe, and they (how profound in learning ſoever) doe hereby diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves to be but private perſons, unable to interpret the propheſies of Scripture, will thus appeare; becauſe by private interpretation of Scripture, is meant, firſt, that we are not to limit or reſtrain the end, aim, or purpoſe of any ſcripture to any particular privat man onely, but that it concernes, and ſpeaks as well to all and every one, as any one; as our Saviour ſeems to hold forth in that one expreſſion, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37. <hi>And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all.</hi> Secondly, becauſe by private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is meant alſo, that the Spirit of God hath no one particular meaning onely in any one propheſie of Scripture, but hath many meanings, and all truths, linked (as a golden chain) one in and with another, as is cleare by 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All Scripture is given by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, and is profitable</hi> (For what?) for one thing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Surely no: but for every thing; for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in righteouſneſſe. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by private interpretation of Scripture, is meant the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation thereof without the Spirit of God: For all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture (though it be by great ones, publicke perſons in a Common-wealth, or by learned ones, by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels or by multitudes of them; yet if they be but meere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, void of the Spirit of God, their own interpretation of Scripture is but private, and for the moſt part falſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man that is in him? even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> So that no man that hath not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, can know the things of God contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, any more then one man can know what is the heart or mind of another. Now as a man may by chance conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or gueſſe what is the minde or thought of another man, (as oftentimes men doe;) even ſo by chance a naturall man, or men, may know or decern the mind of God in the Scripture, and many times they doe; yet it is by chance: and although
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:159925:7"/> carnall men that have nothing of God in them at all, have preached many truths; yet it hath not been by themſelves, but onely by the light of gracious men that have interpreted the Scriptures by the Spirit of God unto them. So that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture by men publick or private, learned or unlearned, without the Spirit of God, is privat interpretation; and all interpretation of Scripture by men publick or private, high or low, rich or poore, young or old, one or many, with and by the Spirit of God, is publick and warrantable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: for that Spirit is truth in whom it is, it neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth nor is deceived. Both of theſe are true and cleare, as is made cleare by the ſame Apoſtle in the following words, (verſe the laſt) which are a reaſon of the former, and runs thus: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Propheſies came not in old time by the will of man, (but by the will of God:) For holy men ſpoke as they were moved by the holy Spirit:</hi> which holy Spirit onely knowes its owne mind in the propheſies of Scripture; and holy men of God onely can conſtantly and truly interpret the propheſies as they, are moved by the holy Spirit: wherefore to ſpeak with tongues, is not eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet, nor is divine prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying reſtrained to humane learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. We rean in 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 3.16. where the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, ſaith, <hi>In which are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable, wreſt, as they doe alſo the other Scriptures, to their owne deſtruction:</hi> Therefore to ſpeak with tongues is eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet, and divine propheſying is reſtrained to humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Apoſtle there ſpeaks of ſome of the Church which doubted and queſtioned the truth of Gods promiſe; as is plain verſe 15. and he in this 16. verſe reproves them for it, and ſhewes them the ground of their doubting, which was, their weakneſſe in grace, or faith, and then labouring to beat them off from impatience, and to confirme them in the promiſe of God by faith, he ſets before them a preſident of their doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, to wit, <hi>Thoſe that are unlearned, &amp;c.</hi> that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified and untaught of Chriſt. Now that it is ſo, the next word <hi>(Vnſtable)</hi> ſhews. Now who are unſtable, wrenching the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:159925:7"/> Scriptures to their own deſtruction, but onely thoſe that are unſanctified, that had never learned Chriſt? <hi>Jam,</hi> 1.8. <hi>A double-minded man is unſtable in all his wayes:</hi> therefore it is not the want of humane learning, but the want of grace that is the cauſe of mens wrenching the Scripture to their owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Moerover, if <hi>Peter,</hi> by <hi>unlearned,</hi> meant ſuch as had no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning, then he ſhould here have excluded himſelfe as well as many others from the underſtanding and ſaving uſe of the Scriptures; For he was unlearned in that reſpect, himſelfe, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.13. and then how durſt he to have adventured upon <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, and the other Scriptures (as he did in that place of the objection) leſt he ſhould wrench them to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? Therefore by learning, he meanes divine learning onely, and ſo excludes none but naturall, unſanctified men from the right and ſaving uſe of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Though <hi>Peter</hi> was not bled a ſcholar, and had not human learning, yet both he and the reſt of the unlearned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, had the tongues given them from heaven by miracle, or miraculouſly, to teach us thus much, that to ſpeake with Tongues is eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet or a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To ſpeak with Tongues now, is not as it was then by the unlearned Apoſtles: in them then, it was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, with us, none, but is common: nor is there now a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſpeak with tongues (by way of miracle wrought from heaven) as the Apoſtles did, becauſe with us there is not now the ſame uſe of it. For firſt, the Apoſtles had then to doe with Heathens, who would not have beleeved their report, nor their word to have been of God, unleſſe they had ſpoken miraculouſly: and ſo not the tongues, but the miraculous ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with them from heaven, was the very cauſe that made many of them to beleeve, and with wonderfull aſtoniſhment to acknowledge God in it, as appeares in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>We doe heare them ſpeak in our own tongues, the wonderfull works of God, and they were all amazed, and were in doubt, ſaying one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, What meaneth this?</hi> whereas, we live in a time wherein there is not that neceſſity for ſpeaking with tongues miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:159925:8"/> from heaven to confirme the Scripture we preach; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all amongſt us, and to whom we preach, doe (at leaſt in a common way) beleeve the Scriptures which we hold out to them, to be the word of God: and if they did not, and if there were any ſuch neceſſity now as was then, I doubt not but God would now confirm it by miracle, either by miraculous ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with tongues now, as he did then, or elſe by ſome other way by miracle: wherefore, (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) this maner of ſpeaking with tongues, is out of date, with us in this time, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.21.22. <hi>With men of other tongues, &amp; other lips, wil I ſpeak unto this people, &amp; yet for all that they will not hear me, ſaith the Lord. Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tongues are for a ſigne not to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, but to them that beleeve not; but propheſying ſerveth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them that beleeve not, but alſo for them that beleeve.</hi> And therefore as the Apoſtles miraculouſly ſpeaking with tongues from heaven, made Infidels that beleeved not the Word, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, and to acknowledge God in it: ſo on the contrary this ſhould be a miracle to us that doe beleeve the Word, to make us the more to beleeve and to admire and acknowledge Gods power in the weakneſſe of illiterate and unlearned men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying and preaching with great power the glorious word of Jeſus Chriſt. Secondly, the Apoſtles were to teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. who were of divers Languages; and therefore they muſt of neceſſity ſpeak with tongues to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all Nations; whereas we ſpeake or preach but to our own Nation, and they all ſpeaking our own Language.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. Though <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles that were unlearned, had the tongues miraculouſly, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4. yet they had not the Languages as an habituall or perpetuall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imprinted in them, as the Languages are in thoſe that have them by ſtudy and practice; but onely whiles they were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or preaching to men and people of thoſe Languages, and was onely an actuall gift which ſhewed it ſelfe when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Spirit came upon them. ſeconding their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified deſires, as is very probable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.18. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I thank my God I ſpeak with Tongues more then you all;</hi> yet <hi>Peter</hi> with the reſt of the unlearned Apoſtles, ſpake with as many tongues as learned <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.12. But now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:159925:8"/> this is a Paradox, yea, a contradiction, and how ſhall theſe two Scriptures be reconciled, you will ſay? I anſwer thus, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake with tongues more then they all, yet not ſpeaking more tongues or languages then <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt: but as ſpeaking thoſe tongues conſtantly, without intermiſſion, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him an habituall perpetuall quality, gained by hard and tedious ſtudy and practice, as they are learned in our dayes; which <hi>Peter</hi> and the other unlearned Apoſtles, that ſpake tongues by the inſpiration of the holy Spirit, did not, being at other times ignorant of them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 22.3.</note> and underſtanding and ſpeaking them onely when and whilſt they had to doe with people of thoſe tongues. And as God alwayes put the Word into their mouthes what they ſhould ſpeak, ſo he gave them the tongue or language in which they ſhould ſpeak it to the underſtanding of the hearers of what Nation or Language ſoever: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the unlearned Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt, had not the tongues in an extraordinary way to underſtand the Scriptures by, but onely to ſpeak to the underſtanding of thoſe to whom they preached the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 3. Although <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the unlearned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles amongſt other tongues, ſpake alſo the learned tongues of the Hebrew, Greek, &amp;c, which our learned men now ſpeak, yet in them theſe tongues were not humane, as they are in us that learn them of men; but divine, having learned them of God onely, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.4. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. Therefore thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and others had not the tongues humane, neither had they any humane learning when they could ſpeak the tongues Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Acts</hi> 24. with chap. 4.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 4. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles had not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, though they could ſometimes ſpeak the learned tongues, becauſe humane learning conſiſts not ſo much in the Languages as in the Sciences. It is poſſible and uſuall for men to ſpeak the languages &amp; tongues, and yet be no Scholars: and again, it is poſſible and uſuall for men to be able Scholars in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the learned Sciences, and Arts, and yet not able to ſpeak with Tongues. And the pith and marrow of humane learning, is the right underſtanding and knowledge of the Arts, which I am ſure <hi>Peter</hi> never learned, as he never learned
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:159925:9"/> the Tongues. Therefore we cannot gather from the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking with tongues miraculouſly by inſpiration of God, that to ſpeak with tongues is eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet, or that divine propheſying is reſtrained to humane learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3.. Our Tranſlation of the Bible is not according to the originall, but is corrupted, and in many places contrary to the Teſtament in the Hebrew and the Greek; and therefore, though in the primitive times, to ſpeak with tongues more then wherein the Scriptures were written, was not eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet; yet notwithſtanding, now it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our tranſlation of the Bible is nought, and the Hebrew and Greek are the originall, in which the Scriptures were firſt written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. For my part, I conceive that our Engliſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Bible is but little differing (if any thing at all) from the originall Copies: for I doe beleeve that God that was good and carefull to commit unto his people as much of his will as was neceſſary for them to know and ſerve him by, and to bring them (through Jeſus Chriſt) to eternall glory, <hi>John</hi> 20.30, 31. would not be leſſe carefull to preſerve it to his people to the end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25. And to theſe Scriptures I will adde one main Reaſon, proving the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that we have and hold, to be Canonicall, and by divine inſpiration; and it is becauſe godly men would not deviſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and write a fiction, for truth, to delude and deceive men by. 2. Wicked men, Gods enemies, to wit, Antichriſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did not deviſe or indite our Bible, becauſe it yeelds them no footing for their wayes, but is altogether againſt their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, ſo farre as they are againſt Jeſus Chriſt; and it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and onely for Jeſus Chriſt: whereas if it were the ſtudy and work of wicked men, Antichriſt and others of Chriſts ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they would have made it ſo, as to, ſerve their own turns, as we ſee they have alwayes, and doe ſtill labour with all their wits, policie and power, to wrench and rend the Scriptures to make them for Antichriſt, and againſt Jeſus Chriſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our Bible is the word of God. But now, if in our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation there be any corruption by the means of ignorance, or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:159925:9"/> malice of Antichriſt, through altering, adding, or diminiſhing of matters of ſmalleſt conſequence (fundamentals being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo cleare to the eyes, and ſo clearly eyed by the Saints of all ages, that they could not be corrupted by the cunning of the enemy. Neither doe I beleeve God would ſuffer it to be done, nor hath he ſuffered it: for not onely in our Bible, but alſo in our tranſlation of it, Chriſt onely is exalted) yet it is clear, that the underſtanding Saints are able in due time to find it out, and to diſcover it. Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.17. &amp; 8.31, 32. &amp; 10.4, 5, &amp; 14.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 12, 15, 16. And for the Saints eaſier and ſurer proceeding in their preaching, or expounding and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the truths of the Scriptures; let them alwayes obſerve this ſhort Rule: Conſider the place of Scripture thou art up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus; 1. Who writ it: 2. To whom it was written: 3. When it was written: 4. Why it was written, and then expound it ſo, and draw ſuch concluſions from it, as will moſt of all magnifie God in his ſeverall Attributes and Merits by ſhewing man his own nothingneſſe and miſery by nature, or fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> with his happineſſe in or by Chriſt onely; and with the preſervation of the analogy, agreement, harmony, and oneneſſe of the Scriptures, that there be no jarring nor diſcord, but concord by the expoſition. Thus a godly man (obſerving this briefe and plain rule in the opening of the Scriptures) may be able to come to know and to preach the very mind of the holy Spirit in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. It is probable, and as likely, that the Bible in all languages and Tongues, is as corrupt as in our Tranſlation or Tongue; &amp; it was as eaſie to corrupt the Teſtament in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew &amp; Greek, as it was to corrupt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our Engliſh tongue, or in any other language. And it is as likely that Antichriſt hath (as much as in him lay) poyſoned the Scriptures as well in the Hebrew and Greek tongues, as in ours or in any other tongue. Wherefore the corruption of our or any other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Bible, makes not the ſpeaking with tongues to be eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet: For though we may have the originall tongues of the Bible, yet we have not the originall Copies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 3. If the Teſtaments in the Hebrew and Greek, are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:159925:10"/> uncorrupted as we have them now, then neither is the ſpeaking with tongues eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet, if our Engliſh tranſlation be undoubtedly corrupt, becauſe we have all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures tranſlated into Engliſh, according to the Teſtaments now in the Hebrew and Greek, ſome by one written, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore, to ſpeak with tongues, is not eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet, nor is divine propheſying reſtrained to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 4. Beſides, if the Teſtaments in their original tongues (as is by the moſt conceived we have them) are as true, divine &amp; authentic, as the originall copies were; yet to ſpeak with thoſe tongues, is not eſſential to the being of a Prophet; becauſe when men do preach to the illiterate and unlearned, they haue no more ground to believe what is ſaid from the originals, then they haue ground from what others haue ſaid from the originals before them, who haue been as honeſt, and as able, as men are now, and haue laboured faithfully to tranſlate the Bible out of the original tongues. And if any now amongſt us, are able to amend our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, if they be as honeſt, and as able, they will do it, or at leaſt labour to do it, not only by parcels in the Pulpit, but alſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and alſo for the ſatisfaction and benefit of all; whereby there will then be no need of tongues to the underſtanding of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and if any can ſo do, and account their paines too great to effect ſo great a good, they are not to be accounted faithfull in that which is leaſt <hi>(to wit)</hi> in what they in a Pulpit by parcels deliver (as they ſay) from the originall, to the illiterate people; &amp; if men may not believe what able and faithfull men afore-time have ſpoken and written from the originall tongues, how ſhall they believe what any particular man ſayes from them now in a Pulpit? wherefore, to ſpeak with tongues, is no more eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet, then they are to the being of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. Again, if to ſpeak the originall tongues of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, be eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet; then, as well any one of thoſe tongues, as all of them, is eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet: whence it will follow, that there is not a true Prophet or Preacher to be found in all the world, much leſſe in <hi>England;</hi> for there is not one man in <hi>England,</hi> nor, in all the world, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:159925:10"/> can ſpeak all the originall tongues, wherein all the Scriptures in the New Teſtament were ſpoken and written: neither doe men now know thoſe tongues: probably, they were thoſe tongues, which the Apoſtles ſpake by divine revelation ſpecified, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. which miracle of ſpeaking with tongues, there was not, as I conceive, only to confirme what they were to ſpeak; but alſo to ſpeak to the underſtanding of all Nations, that they were to ſpeak or preach to; that is, that they might be able to preach to every people in their own language, as they did; as appeares, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. and that this was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, appeares in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.18, 19 I thank God I ſpeak with tongues more then you all; yet in the Church, I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that by my voyce, I might teach others alſo, then ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue; and as hee ſpake to the Churches, ſo doubtleſſe he wrote to the Churches in a known tongue alſo, that he might teach them in that way alſo, which out of all queſtion, was likewiſe the practiſe of all the reſt of the Apoſtles. Now who can tell me what were the tongues that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, and wherein he wrote to the <hi>Romanes, Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Galathians, Epheſians, Philipians, Colſſioans, Theſſalonians,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Timotheus, Titus, Philemon,</hi> and to the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in what tongue St. <hi>James</hi> his Epiſtle was written firſt, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Epiſtles, and St. <hi>Iohns</hi> 3. Epiſtles, and St. <hi>Iudes?</hi> Beſides, I would fain know in what tongue, or tongues, the ſaid St. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote the <hi>Revelation to the</hi> 7. <hi>Churches in Aſia, Revel.</hi> 1.4. If any can infallibly tell me, then I ask, who is that one man that can ſpeak all thoſe tongues, and write the ſame languages, wherein thoſe Epiſtles were firſt ſpoken and written by the Apoſtles? but there is no ſuch man in all the world, much leſſe in <hi>England:</hi> and therefore, if to ſpeak with the tongues, wherein the Scriptures were written and ſpoken by the Apoſtles, be eſſential to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Prophet, or Preacher of the Goſpel in <hi>England;</hi> then is there no Prophet or Preacher of the Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi> nor yet in the world: but there are true Prophets and Preachers in the world, and in <hi>England</hi> that have not the tongues, as well as they that have them: therefore, to ſpeak with tongues is not eſſential to the being of a Prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. We read in the 1 of <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.5. in the ſame verſe, where
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:159925:11"/> the words run thus, <hi>I would that you all ſpake with tongues:</hi> but rather that you propheſied for greater, is he that propheſieth, then he that ſpeaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the Church may receive edifying; therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not at all againſt what is laid down; for all that St. <hi>Paul</hi> holds forth unto us here, is briefly this: namely, <hi>that it is a good thing to ſpeak with tongues, but that it is far better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie:</hi> and that it is beſt of all to ſpeak with tongues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie too in that ſence; he there meaneth, as you will plainly ſee, if you do well ponder the words: Beſides, <hi>Paul</hi> in the 18. verſe, is ſo far from contemning the tongues, that he bleſſeth God even for this, that he ſpake with tongues more then they all; &amp; in the 39. verſe, he ſaith, <hi>Brethren, covet to propheſie, and forbid not to ſpeak with tongues:</hi> So that all St. <hi>Paul</hi> holds forth, here; is, that to ſpeak with tongues, is excellent in his ſence, and that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying is more excellent, and that they are two diſtinct gifts, and that where they meet together, they are moſt ſweet and excellent and ſo humane learning is an excellent ſervant or hand-maid to propheſying, when it is rightly imployed in its right ſtation; for as in the building of the materiall temple of God, he made uſe of humane Arts in their time &amp; place: ſo our humane learned arts may be uſed in their time and place for the building of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall temple; provided, that they be not uſed as of neceſſity, but only as convenient, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16.</p>
            <p>Now in the building of the material temple, all humane arts &amp; ſciences were uſed in the woods &amp; quarries, in digging, felling, hewing, ſquaring &amp; fitting all materials for that building: ſo that when all the materials were brought together to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the whole Fabrick was erected and finiſhed, without ſo much as the noiſe of a hammer, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.7. and the houſe when it was in building, was built of ſtone, made ready before it was brought thither; ſo that there was neither hammer nor axe, nor any tool of Iron heard in the houſe while it was building.</p>
            <p>Even ſo in the building of the Spirituall Temple, let us uſe all our humane Arts and Sciences (as convenient, and no more, in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:159925:11"/> quarries and woods; that is to ſay, in our cloſets and ſtudies, where, by the Spirit of God, let us fit our matter or Sermons, that when we come to aſſay to build, and ſet up the Temple of Chriſt thereby, there may appear nothing of man, but all of God: and that there may appear nothing at all of our ſelves, but all of Chriſt; and that there may not appeare nor be heard ſo much as the blow of an hammer or axe of humane learning, but all of rhe holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.18, 19. and the 1. and the 17.20. to the 29. So that humane learning, or the Tongues and Arts ſanctified, is excellent, and propheſying much more excellent, but both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt excellent: yet ſo too, that to ſpeak with tongues is not eſſentiall to the being of a Prophet, or that divine propheſying is not reſtrained to Humane Learning.</p>
            <p>Thus, the Doctrine being cleared; the Vſes thereof, are brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>It may be this, to tell <hi>England</hi> of her great Idoll and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in Idolizing Humane Learning, which hath been ſo abuſed; that there is great cauſe to cry down the blame of our Nation in this particular: for ſo hath Humane Learning been abuſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us by the idolizing of it, that we have not only made it equall with propheſie, but propheſie it ſelf: So that without it a man though never ſo gratious and able to preach Chriſt, was with the conſent of our whole Nation, and with their generall power reſtrained: Whereas another, that had Humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though he were as black as Hell, and as prophane as the Divell; yet was ordained, entertained, and honoured as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Preacher of Jeſus Chriſt:</p>
            <p>And ſometime, when there hath been ſuch a prophane Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to be ordained Miniſter by a Biſhop, and ſome amongſt us have been ready to except againſt him, as unfit, in regard of his prophaneneſſe;</p>
            <p>There was commonly this anſwer made: why? he is a Scholler, &amp; hath taken degrees in the Vniverſity, &amp;c. as if a Vniverſity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Scholler were without all exception a Prophet of Chriſt.

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Is to exhort all our learned Prophets, that they be ſo far from endeavouring to ſeal up the mouthes, and ſuppreſſing the graces of our Prophets, which ſpeak not the tongues; that they do their diligence rather to open their mouths, and unloſe their tongues, &amp; incourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the holding forth of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who holds himſelf out to all, that al that are gifted &amp; graced by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, might alſo hold him forth to others; &amp; let it not be accounted any diſgrace to any of the learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that poor illiterate men, which ſhould preach &amp; ſpread the glory of God our Saviour, remember the modeſt words &amp; carriage of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Prophet of the Lord, in his anſwer to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and the young-man that brought tydings that <hi>Eldad</hi> &amp; <hi>Medad</hi> prophecied in the Campe, &amp; bad <hi>Moſes</hi> to forbid them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.26, 27, 29. &amp; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto him; <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt thou for my ſake? would God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his ſpirit upon them;</hi> which teacheth us thus much, that a true Prophet of the Lord will not for any by-ends envie the gifts of God in others, nor deſire the obſcure, but to diſcover them; wiſhing, all, as well as ſome of the Lords people were Prophets; not by putting Vniverſity, Arts but: by putting the Apoſtles approbation in the New Teſtament, is this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Ye may propheſie all one by one, that all may learn and all may be comforted, all may propheſie;</hi> that is, all the Prophets, <hi>to wit,</hi> all that God hath endued with the Spirit of Prophecie: for there is no reſtraint, obſerving their time and order one by one: Wherefore, let none dare to forbid prophecie, where God himſelf commands, and his Word gives both freedome and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; for further proof, read <hi>Act.</hi> 8.4.</p>
